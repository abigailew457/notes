This is a basic notes file html to track my progress 
and attempt to replicate new material I encounter.

I have already complted the introduction to intermediate HTML 
and CSS Course. And have become aquanted with Emmet. 
I learned that emmet is a helpful writing tool to make 
writing in VS Code much more efficient. And I learned
how to make my own shortcuts. 
I used opt + w for wrap with abbreviation 
and opt + r for remove tag.

Emmet knowledge check; 
Why should you use Emmet?
    Emmet makes writing code much quicker and more efficient.
What are some useful Emmet abbreviations?
    ! for boilerplate
    opt + w for wrap with abbreviation 
    opt + r for remove tag
    > for child // + for sibling // ^ for climb out of child
What syntax would you use to create this element <p class="text"></p>?
    p.text
What syntax expands to an element with a child element inside of it? For example: <div><p></p></div>
    > for example div>p
What syntax would you use to create three elements that have the same class name?
    element.classname*number example div.class*3

SVG: 
Learning outcomes
    What SVGs, Vector Graphics, and XML are
    How to create simple SVGs and add them to your websites
    When to use SVGs, and when a different image format would be more appropriate


What is it? 
    Scalable Vector Graphics
    an image format that can be sized to anything wothout loosing their
    quality and without changing their filesize. 
    Vector Graphics are images defined by math instead of a grid of pixels.

XML - Extensible Markup Language
    1. Makes the source-code readable
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
            <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=50 />
            <circle class="svg-circle" cx="50" cy="50" r="10"/>
        </svg>
    2. Can be put directly into HTML as is. And can be targeted with CSS. 

Drawbacks 
    Only for simple pictures as they are complicated to write out. 
    It is more common to copy or download the code from a website 
    or image editor that can create them (like adobe illustrator and Figma)

xmlns - XML NameSpace
        Specifies what dialect of XML you're using. This is helpful for 
        browsers when rendering the images.
        full breakdown: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course

viewbox 
    defines the positions of different points of the elements, 
    defines the aspect ratio, and the origin of your SVG
    basically changes the shape of all the pieces in the image.

class, id 
    allow css and javascript targeting

elements are the basic building blocks for the images
        including <feColorMatrix> // <circle> // <animate>

Many atttributes can be changed in css

Embedding SVGs
    linked vs inline
        linked can be linked into html like any other image 
        it will still scale properly but the content won't  
        be accessible from the webpage.

        inlining is to paste the content of the SVG directly into the <html>
        It will render correctly and the properties will be visible
        to the code so they can be altered dynamically in CSS or javascript
        Downside is it can make code harder to read and if the SVG is too large
        it will slow down code.



SVG knowledge check;
What is the xmlns attribute?
    It specifies the dialect of XMl which makes it so any browser can 
    successfully render the image.
What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?
    When you are working with a complicated or detailed image.
What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?
    Benefits: you can access the SVG aspects from the browser and that
            allows you to change it through CSS or javascript
    Downside: It can make code look messy and slow it down if its complicated.


Tables:
Learning outcomes
    By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:
    Create advanced HTML tables.

What is it? 
    Two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns

use <table></table> to create the table and put the elements for 
rows, columns, headers, or anything else inside.
    example: 
        <table>
            <tr>
            <th>First Header</th>
            <th>Second Header</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>This is a data cell</td>
            <td>This is also a data cell!</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
