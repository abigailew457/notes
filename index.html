This is a basic notes file html to track my progress 
and attempt to replicate new material I encounter.

I have already complted the introduction to intermediate HTML 
and CSS Course. And have become aquanted with Emmet. 
I learned that emmet is a helpful writing tool to make 
writing in VS Code much more efficient. And I learned
how to make my own shortcuts. 
I used opt + w for wrap with abbreviation 
and opt + r for remove tag.
