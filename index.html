This is a basic notes file html to track my progress 
and attempt to replicate new material I encounter.

I have already complted the introduction to intermediate HTML 
and CSS Course. And have become aquanted with Emmet. 
I learned that emmet is a helpful writing tool to make 
writing in VS Code much more efficient. And I learned
how to make my own shortcuts. 
I used opt + w for wrap with abbreviation 
and opt + r for remove tag.

Emmet knowledge check; 
Why should you use Emmet?
    Emmet makes writing code much quicker and more efficient.
What are some useful Emmet abbreviations?
    ! for boilerplate
    opt + w for wrap with abbreviation 
    opt + r for remove tag
    > for child // + for sibling // ^ for climb out of child
What syntax would you use to create this element <p class="text"></p>?
    p.text
What syntax expands to an element with a child element inside of it? For example: <div><p></p></div>
    > for example div>p
What syntax would you use to create three elements that have the same class name?
    element.classname*number example div.class*3

SVG: 
Learning outcomes
    What SVGs, Vector Graphics, and XML are
    How to create simple SVGs and add them to your websites
    When to use SVGs, and when a different image format would be more appropriate


What is it? 
    Scalable Vector Graphics
    an image format that can be sized to anything wothout loosing their
    quality and without changing their filesize. 
    Vector Graphics are images defined by math instead of a grid of pixels.

XML - Extensible Markup Language
    1. Makes the source-code readable
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 100 100">
            <rect x=0 y=0 width=100 height=50 />
            <circle class="svg-circle" cx="50" cy="50" r="10"/>
        </svg>
    2. Can be put directly into HTML as is. And can be targeted with CSS. 

Drawbacks 
    Only for simple pictures as they are complicated to write out. 
    It is more common to copy or download the code from a website 
    or image editor that can create them (like adobe illustrator and Figma)

xmlns - XML NameSpace
        Specifies what dialect of XML you're using. This is helpful for 
        browsers when rendering the images.
        full breakdown: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Namespaces_Crash_Course

viewbox 
    defines the positions of different points of the elements, 
    defines the aspect ratio, and the origin of your SVG
    basically changes the shape of all the pieces in the image.

class, id 
    allow css and javascript targeting

elements are the basic building blocks for the images
        including <feColorMatrix> // <circle> // <animate>

Many atttributes can be changed in css

Embedding SVGs
    linked vs inline
        linked can be linked into html like any other image 
        it will still scale properly but the content won't  
        be accessible from the webpage.

        inlining is to paste the content of the SVG directly into the <html>
        It will render correctly and the properties will be visible
        to the code so they can be altered dynamically in CSS or javascript
        Downside is it can make code harder to read and if the SVG is too large
        it will slow down code.



SVG knowledge check;
What is the xmlns attribute?
    It specifies the dialect of XMl which makes it so any browser can 
    successfully render the image.
What are some situations where you wouldn’t want to use SVG?
    When you are working with a complicated or detailed image.
What are the benefits of “inlining” your SVGs? What are the drawbacks?
    Benefits: you can access the SVG aspects from the browser and that
            allows you to change it through CSS or javascript
    Downside: It can make code look messy and slow it down if its complicated.


Tables:
Learning outcomes
    By the end of this lesson, you should be able to do the following:
    Create advanced HTML tables.

What is it? 
    Two-dimensional tables made of rows and columns

use <table></table> to create the table and put the elements for 
rows, columns, headers, or anything else inside.
    example: 
        <table>
            <tr>
            <th>First Header</th>
            <th>Second Header</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td>This is a data cell</td>
            <td>This is also a data cell!</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

Table basics
    Information is easily interpreted by making visual 
    associations between row and column headers.

    Screen readers make tables accessible for visually 
    impaired users.

    You need both styling with CSS and solid structure
    with HTML to make an effective and readsable table.

    tables should be used for tabular data not web page layouts
        - layout tables reduce accessibility for visually 
          impaired users. screen readers read out the tags
          table layouts are too complex and confuse the screen readers.

        - table layouts make it harder to write, maintain,
          and debug code. 
        
        - Extra work to style tables consistently across 
          platforms. Proper layout automatically fills 
          to the size of the parent while tables don't.

Active Learning
    all table elements need to be placed in <table></table>
    to make an element you use <td></td>
    headers are made by changing the td to <th></th>
    headers are beneficial because they make the tables
    more readable and clear. They also make it so screen 
    readers read our a whole row or column of data at once.
    colspan and rowspan allow to display table data ponts 
    across multiple rows. 
    <col> and <colgroup> elements allow you to define 
    styling into onto a whole row.
    example: 
        <table>
            <colgroup>
                <col>
                <col>
            </colgroup>
        </table>
    If you want to only apply the style to the second column
    you need an empty col otherwise the style will be added
    to the first column. If we want to apply the same style 
    can span it. 

Captions are usful not only to allow readers to decide if the table
is relevent to them and their needs but mostly for visually impaired readers.
A caption allows the saves them from having to listen to the whole table and
gives them the ability in advance to decide if its worth going through. That 
is why the caption element is always placed right after the opening table element.

When making more complex tables you can use thead, tfoot, and tbody
these dont make tables more accessible for screen readers but they 
are useful for styling. thead should be placed right after caption.
Order can go; thead, tbody, tfoot or thead, tfoot, tbody. 

Nesting is possible though not ideal. Sometimes necessary.

To make tables more accessible to visually impaired users you can use
scope atttributes which tell the screen readers if the headers is a 
colheader or a rowheader. colgroup and rowgroup can be used to identify 
headers for a group of headers. Alternatively  you can write specific 
headers and id to all the tb or th's.

Knowledge check;
What is a table?
    rows and columns used to make reading data easier.
Why is it a bad idea to use HTML Tables for page layout?
    Reduces accessability for visually impaired users, 
    makes working with the code harder, and creates extra work
    for cross platform use.
What are caption elements useful for?
    Allows the user to decide if the table is for them. 
    Mostly important for visually impaired users.
What is the scope attribute?
    scope makes the tables more accessible for screen readers.
    The identify whether the headers belong to a column or a row 
    and they can identify headers for spesicif header groups.

Default Styles
    All browsers have a bit pf preset css in their pages. The problem is They
    can vary between sites even if most are minor. Plus often many developers 
    end up undoing the set css to make the site look exactly as they want it to.
    To undo they use a CSS Reset. 

The Meyer Reset
    a basic blueprint to reset the browsers css. It is meant to be used as a starting 
    point not an end all. It should be taken and changed to fit the style you want 
    added to your personal page. 

Normalize.css
    Is an alternative to the css resets. Its aim is to keep useful browsers css,
    normalize styles for a wide range of HTML elements, correct bugs, improve 
    usability, and explain the code. 

    Rather then flatlinign and completely defaulting everything to a base nothing 
    normalize keeps useful defaults and makes them consistent acrodd browsers
    to avoid needing to redeclare the useful defaults after removing them. 
    
    It fixes common bugs that are out of reach of the resets. 

    It doesnt clutter uo the code. And its broken down in a way that makes it 
    easy to read and change to personal needs.

Knowledge check;
Why would you want to use a CSS reset?
    To provide consistency across browsers.


CSS Units:
Absolute Units 
    Always the same in any context. px is the only relevant absolute unit for web projects.
    It is an absolute because the size of a px doesnt change relative to anything else on the page.

relative Units
    Can change based on their context. 
    em and rem both refer to font size. em is the font size of an element or the parent 
    element is setting font size. If the font size is 16px and the width is set to 4em 
    the width would be 64px (16x4). While rem is the font size of the root (:root or HTML). 
    rem is recommended.

Viewport Units
    vh and vw relate to the viewport size. vh being 1% the height and vw the width. 
    Most useful when you want somthing to size to the viewport.



knowledge check;
Why would you want to use em or rem for font-size instead of px?
    To make it more accessible. When font-size is in rem or em users can
    change the text size to their needs.
What are some instances where you might want to use vh and vw?
    With calc() it can be useful to make the text adjust size to the viewport.
    calc() provides a base size so that the text size doesnt shrink too fast or
    too small. 
    When using full-height layouts and sticky footers.
What are some instances where you might want to use px instead of a relative unit?
    With margin to avoid unnessecary white space. Or if you aren't able to accommodate
    text wrapping and overflow.

Fonts
    The system font stack - When applying a font that is not installed in the users computer
    the font will be defaulted to a fallback font. If a fallback font is not established
    it will default to the basic HTML font which is not always the prettiest. Because of this 
    it is common to write a font-family with a large number of font options to default to. The 
    browser will work through till an available font is found. 
    You can also use an online font library to use a font not installed by adding either a link 
    to the HTML or an @import to the top of the CSS or use a downloaded font with @font-face 
    example: 
    @font-face {
        font-family: my-cool-font;
        src: url(../fonts/the-font-file.woff); 
    }

    but it is still best to provide a fallback. 

Text styles
    font-style - <em> tag is used not only for styling but to add specific emphasis on a piece 
    of text. If you simply want to italicize for aesthetic purposes then you can use font-style: italic;
    but if you want to add specific emphasis to a word, phrase, or sentence then <em> should be used. 

    letter-spacing - add space between letters. Best used to edit the look of custom fonts and should
    be used carefully so as not to make the page unreadable. 

    line-height - adjusts the space between lines in a wrapped text for readability. 

    text-transform - changes the case of a text.

    text-shadow - adds a shadow around the text. Best used with headers or presentational text. 

    ellipsis - with the help of some other properties text-overflow can truncate overflowing text 
    with an ellipsis. 
    example: 
    .overflowing {
        white-space: nowrap;
        overflow: hidden;
        text-overflow: ellipsis;
    }

Knowledge check;
What are the 2 ways to add fonts that are not installed on a users computer?
    You can <link> them into the HTML or @import them into the top of the CSS. 
    Or you can add you own downloaded font with @font-face. 
What is the (system font stack) and why would you want to use it?
    The system font stack is when you apply multiple fonts into your font style in order to ensure
    you have fallback if the selected font is not installed in the users computer. 
Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between letters in a word?
    letter-spacing
Which property would you use to increase or decrease the space between lines in a paragraph?
    line-height

More CSS Properties: 
Background 
    background property is shorthand for 8 different background-related properties. 
    It is possible to use these properties individually and sometimes it is better to. 
    These properties are attachment, clip, color, image, origin, position, repeat, and size. 
    If something is not set in the background property it is set to the default. 
    Background properties do not provide any information to screen readers. If the background contains
    anything critical to understand the page overall then that information should be described 
    semantically in the document. 

Borders
    Also a shorthand but much less complicated. You just need to define a size, style, and color.
    The border property sets width, style, and color. The order does not matter. The border property
    is used when trying to target all sides of a border. If you want differences in sides then you have 
    to target each property individually, border-width/-style/-color, which lets you target each side
    individually.
    Border-radius is the property that applies a rounded corner on things. The radius applies to the whole
    background even if the element has no border. It is specified as 1-4 length or percentage values.

Box-shadow
    Adds a shadow effect around an element. It is described by X and Y offsets relative to the element,
    blur and spread radius, and color. Preset border-radius is set to any box-shadow. 

Overflow
    Allows you to define what happens to an element when its content is too big to fit. These values are
    visible, hidden, clip, scroll, auto, and hidden visible. A scrolling content area cannot be scrolled 
    by a keyboard-only user so you need to give it a tabindex using tabindex="0". But when screen readers
    encounter tabindex the read the entire content so you need to ass an appropriate WAI-ARIA roll 
    like roll='region'. 

Opacity 
    The degree to which the content behind an element is hidden. It applies to the element as a whole.


Knowledge check;
Which property would you use to make an element transparent?
    opacity 
Which property would you use to make a background image tile?
    background-image
Which property would you use to add scrollbars to an element?
    overflow auto or overflow scroll. The difference is that scroll will set to both directions 
    regardless of whether there is overflow while auto will only set to the direction that has
    overflow.
Which property would you use to add a shadow behind an element?
    box-shadow
Which property would you use to create rounded corners on an element?
    border-radius
How would you use border-radius to make a circular element?
    border-radius: 50%;
